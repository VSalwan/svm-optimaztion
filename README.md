# Parameter Optimization of Support Vector Machines

We used the Scikit-learn library in Python to implement our SVM model and optimize its parameters. The dataset we used for this project was Chess (King-Rook vs. King) Data Set. After splitting the dataset into 10 random samples, we trained and tested our SVM model using various parameter combinations.

The final result of our project is a table that shows the accuracy of each of the 10 samples, along with the best SVM parameters that yielded the highest accuracy. This table can be used as a reference for future classification problems that require SVM parameter optimization.

Feel free to explore the code and results in this repository, and please let us know if you have any questions or feedback.
